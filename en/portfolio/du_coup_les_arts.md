**— video editor — motion designer — graphic designer — cameraman —**

Named after a typical French saying, "Du coup les arts" is a short talk show about art and culture. Produced for a TV production course, I collaborated with 30 talented individuals to deliver the motion design and final edit of the show's two episodes.
